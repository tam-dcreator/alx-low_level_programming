Project Title

C Programming Course Project - Preprocessors

Description

This repository contains codes on Preprocessors.
The code aims to provide an understanding of what preprocessors are,
their role in programming languages, and how they can be utilized to enhance
code functionality and maintainability.
Preprocessors are powerful tools that enable us to perform advanced
manipulations on our code before it is compiled. They are widely used in
programming languages like C. Preprocessors provide additional capabilities,
such as macro expansion, conditional compilation, and file inclusion.
