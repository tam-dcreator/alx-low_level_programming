Project Title

C - Dynamic libraries

Description

This project explores the concept of the Dynamic Libraries. It involves creating precompiled pieces of code that can be loaded and executed by programs at runtime. These libraries, distinct from static libraries linked during compilation, promote code reusability, efficient memory usage, and easier updates. This repository provides example implementations of C dynamic libraries.
